# Analysis-of-The-Prison-Break-Helicopter-Escapes
Background
There have been multiple prison escapes where an inmate escapes by means of a helicopter. One of the earliest instances was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971, from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.

The following questions are to be answered
1: In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
2: In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?
3: In which countries do helicopter prison breaks have a higher chance of success?
4: How does the number of escapees affect the success?
5: Which escapees have done it more than once?

To answer the above questions, data from this [Wikipedia] page was scraped and analyzed. It covers the details of attempted helicopter prison escapes over a period of 50 years (1971-2020)
